Forget-Me-Not

4 – What You’ll Have to Learn

We’ll have to learn more about authentication. We’ll also have to learn more about how to collaborate with each other throughout the course of this project, because we didn’t have the opportunity to collaborate during the independent track of this project. We’ll also have to learn how to allow the user to sign in with Google.
